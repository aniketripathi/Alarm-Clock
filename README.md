Alarm Clock

Alarm Clock is a java based GUI application. This is my first project and is solely for education purpose. The application sets the alarm for a given time and displays an alert with a message and a tone.

Resources: An alarm clock icon and audio tone is used. I do not take credit for any of the resources. Custom alarm tones can be added by following these steps..

1) Assume jar file to be a zip file.

2) Open the file with any zip file explorer like winrar.

3) Add your tone to the folder main/resources/audio/

4) Your tone will be automatically loaded next time when you run the application.

For custom alarm message, there is an option in the settings.

To download the application download the jar file.

Fixed bugs: Settings window not loading.
