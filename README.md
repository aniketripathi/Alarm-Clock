Alarm Clock

Alarm Clock is a java based GUI application. The application sets the alarm for a given time and displays an alert with a message and a tone.

Resources: An alarm clock icon and audio tone is used. I do not take credit for any of the resources. Custom alarm tones can be added by following these steps..

To download the alarm clock simpley download the AlarmClock folder. Notice that it contains an audio folder and a jar file.

1) Copy your tone into the audio folder inside AlarmClock directory.

2) Your tone will be automatically loaded next time when you run the application.

3) Note that your tone must be in *.wav format.The application may not play the tone if it doesn't matches the required format.

For custom alarm message, there is an option in the settings.

Fixed bugs: Settings window not loading.
Recent Fix: Alarm tone not loaded sometimes.
